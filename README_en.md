# Rominesweeper 🔎💣

A minesweeper with roman numbers, just to add some confusion. Why not?

The app was developed with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) and uses [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/es/) components. It was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which includes [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

📝TO DO: many improvements and lots of tests pending.

## Running the app

The project is deployed in Github Pages at https://rsegretin.github.io/rominesweeper/

Once dependencies are installed, just run `yarn start` to start the app locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
